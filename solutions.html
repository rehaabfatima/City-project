        <h1>POSSIBLE STEPS TO BE TAKEN TO CONSEVE ENERGY.</h1>
        <ul>
            <h2>The following steps can be taken to conserve energy:</h2>
            <li>Delivers 25 kw per machine power generation from low speed, bird safe windmill</li>
            <li> Maintains 200 kw per machine internal storage capacity</li>
            <li>Low power density –50% less solar panels and 80% less batteries</li>
            <li>High reliability –only one moving part per machine</li>
            <li>High efficiency –no grid transformers used for power distribution</li>
            <li>BY using <b>Energy Management System</b>Energy management systems (EMS) aid companies in cost savings through identified inefficiencies, predictive maintenance to reduce downtime, and participation in demand-response programs. </li>
            <li>We need to accelerate our global energy transition towards a cleaner, more equitable and secure energy system, or miss 2050 net-zero targets.</li>
            <li>Using Lithium glass tube.The importance of batteries in the renewable energy transition is huge. With lithium-ion batteries, John Goodenough’s innovation, we have the most energy-dense, reliable batteries which are used in electric vehicles and many electronic devices</li>
